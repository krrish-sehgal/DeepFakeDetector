// - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

//? - JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
//? 1. **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user or client.
//? 2. **Authorization:** Determining what actions a user or client is allowed to perform.

// **Components of a JWT:**
// - Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the signing algorithm being used.

// - Payload: Contains claims or statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
// Common claims include user ID, username, and expiration time.

// - Signature
// To verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way, a signature is included.
