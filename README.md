This repository includes : 
1. A Node.js web application built with express and ejs where users can come and post images and get a deepfake score.
2. A Flask API which is where the Mesonet model runs and processes the images and provides the data back to the web app.
3. A chrome extension , which comes with a snipping tool that allows users to snip images from the web and get a deepfake score right there in the extension pop up.
